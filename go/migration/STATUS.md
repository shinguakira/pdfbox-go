# Porting status

Hand maintained. Update the row for a package in the same commit that ports it.

The machine-generated counterpart is
[`mapping/inventory.tsv`](mapping/inventory.tsv), which knows how much Java
source sits behind each row but only distinguishes "has Go files" from "has
none". This file is where partial work and the reasons for it get recorded.

Status values: `done` · `in progress` · `blocked` · `not started` · `out of scope`

Branch `slice/1-open-document`. Ported test-first.

19 of 24 files ported — everything slice 1 needs. Of the remaining five, four
are the incremental-save machinery deferred to slice 7 and one is folded into
`stream.go`.

| `COSStream.java` | `stream.go` | done — minus the update state; **written before its test**, see the method note |
| `COSInputStream.java` | — | not ported — `Stream.CreateReader` returns a plain `io.Reader`; the class exists in Java only to carry a `DecodeResult` |

### Ported tests — `cos`

| Java test | Go test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TestCOSBase` | `base_test.go` | abstract in Java; becomes `assertBaseContract`, called per type |
| `TestCOSBoolean` | `boolean_test.go` | complete except the COSWriter byte assertions |
| `COSObjectKeyTest` | `objectkey_test.go` | `testPDFBox5742` not ported — needs parser, writer, multipdf and a renderer |
| `TestCOSName` | `name_test.go` | all three Java tests drive documents; their real assertions (`/m#E4nnlich`, `/m#00nnlich`, PDFBOX-4076) are asserted against `WritePDF` directly |
| `TestCOSNumber` | `number_test.go` | complete |
| `TestCOSInteger` | `integer_test.go` | complete |
| `TestCOSFloat` | `float_test.go` | complete |
| `TestCOSString` | `string_test.go` | COSWriter serialisation assertions replaced by checks on `Bytes`, `ToHexString` and `ForceHexForm` |
| `PDFDocEncodingTest` | `pdfdocencoding_test.go` | complete, including PDFBOX-3864 |
| `TestCOSArray` | `array_test.go` | complete |
| `COSDictionaryTest` | `dictionary_test.go` | `testCOSDictionaryNotEqualsCOSStream` needs `COSStream`; the identity semantics it guards are covered |
| `UnmodifiableCOSDictionaryTest` | `unmodifiable_test.go` | every assertion is a compile error in Go, so nothing is left to assert at run time |
| — | `null_test.go`, `object_test.go` | Java has no test for these; written from the source per the tdd rule |

### Deviations — `cos`

**Open debt — must be closed when `pdfwriter` lands.** The Java `accept()` tests
drive a `COSWriter` and assert the emitted bytes. `COSWriter` is not ported, so
the port asserts the visitor double dispatch plus a direct `WritePDF` byte
check. **Until then the serialised form is only checked against itself.** This
applies to `boolean_test.go`, `integer_test.go`, `float_test.go` and
`string_test.go`.

Deliberate differences, each commented at the point it occurs:

- `Name` is interned through `weak.Pointer` and `runtime.AddCleanup`, the
  equivalents of Java's `WeakReference` plus `Cleaner`. Interning makes `==`
  equivalent to content equality and lets a `*Name` be a Go map key, which is
  what `Dictionary` needs.
- `Dictionary` keeps key insertion order in a slice, because Java's
  `LinkedHashMap` has it and Go maps do not. A dictionary is written back in the
  order it was read.
- `Dictionary` keys everything on `*Name`. Java declares a `String` and a
  `COSName` overload of nearly every accessor; Go has no overloading, and
  interned names make the pointer form cheap.
- `AsReadOnly` returns an interface with no mutating methods, so a write is a
  compile error. Java returns a `COSDictionary` that throws at run time.
- `cosEqual` dispatches to the `Equals` method of the types that define one.
  Java relies on every class overriding `equals`; Go has no single such hook,
  and every container comparison goes through this one function.
- `Visitor` and the ported types are deliberately smaller than the Java
  originals where a dependency is not ported yet; each says so in its doc
  comment.

Behaviour that is **not** a deviation, listed because it looks like one:
`Integer.Equals` truncates to 32 bits, `ParseHexString` honours a `ForceParsing`
flag, `assertBytesEqual` does not check lengths, and `Name.Bytes` returns the
internal slice. All four match the Java, and the first three are recorded in
[`JAVA-BUGS.md`](JAVA-BUGS.md) as defects carried over deliberately.

### Port defects found in review, fixed

Five places where the Go did something the Java does not. All were caught by
review rather than by the ported tests, which is worth noting: the tests were
written from the Java and still missed these, because each one turns on a
detail of how Go differs from Java rather than on what PDFBox does.

- `Integer.IntValue` did not truncate to 32 bits — Go's `int(int64)` is a no-op
  where Java's `(int)` narrows. This also meant `Equals` was **not** reproducing
  JAVA-BUGS entry 1 despite a comment claiming it did.
- `Float.IntValue` and `LongValue` did not saturate. Java clamps an out-of-range
  float to `MAX_VALUE`/`MIN_VALUE`; Go leaves the conversion undefined.
- `Flate.Decode` propagated a corrupt-input error, so `Stream.CreateReader`
  returned no reader and the decoded prefix was unreachable. Java catches,
  logs and returns what inflated — the damage tolerance the filter exists for.
- `Stream.Length` answered while a writer was open, returning a stale value.
  Java throws there; the Go now returns `ErrStreamWriting`.
- `XrefTrailerResolver` resolved to no type when startxref pointed nowhere. The
  Java constructor defaults it to `TABLE`.

## Slice 1 — `pdfbox/filter`

Only the filters slice 1 needs. The rest arrive in slice 6.

| Java source | Go source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Filter.java` | `filter.go` | done — minus the `DecodeOptions` overload, which carries image subsampling |
| `FilterFactory.java` | `filter.go`, `provider.go` | done — as `ByName` plus a `Provider` type rather than a singleton |
| `Predictor.java` | `predictor.go` | done |
| `FlateFilter.java`, `FlateFilterDecoderStream.java` | `flate.go` | done |
| `IdentityFilter.java` | `filter.go` | done |
| `DecodeResult.java` | `filter.go` | partial — the JPX colour space and soft mask fields arrive with that filter |
| `DecodeOptions.java` | — | not started — image subsampling only |
| the other 15 filters | — | slice 6 |

| Java test | Go test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PredictorTest` | `predictor_test.go` | complete |
| `TestFilters` | `flate_test.go` | the round-trip generator is ported; `testPDFBOX4517` needs a loader, `testPDFBOX1977` needs LZW, `testRLE` needs RunLength |

## Slice 1 — `pdfbox/pdfparser`

8 of 18 files ported. This is the package `AGENTS.md` flags as historically
bug-prone, so it is ported line for line and every recovery path is kept.

| Java source | Go source | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BaseParser.java` | `base.go` | done — the lexer |
| `XrefTrailerResolver.java` | `xreftrailer.go` | done |
| `xref/XReferenceType.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `xref/XReferenceEntry.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `xref/AbstractXReference.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `xref/FreeXReference.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `xref/NormalXReference.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `xref/ObjectStreamXReference.java` | `xref/xref.go` | done |
| `COSParser.java` | — | **next — 2,021 lines, the core** |
| `XrefParser.java` | — | not started — 695 lines |
| `BruteForceParser.java` | — | not started — 857 lines, the damaged-file recovery path |
| `PDFStreamParser.java` | — | not started — 497 lines |
| `PDFXRefStream.java` | — | not started |
| `PDFXrefStreamParser.java` | — | not started |
| `PDFParser.java` | — | not started — the entry point |
| `PDFObjectStreamParser.java` | — | not started |
| `EndstreamFilterStream.java` | — | not started |
| `FDFParser.java` | — | not started — FDF, not needed for slice 1 |

None of the Java files in this package have tests; the parsers are exercised
only through whole documents. Every test here is therefore written from the
source per the tdd rule, and the recovery paths named in the Java comments —
PDFBOX-3506, PDFBOX-276, brother_scan_cover.pdf — are pinned individually.

### Method note — `cos/stream.go` was not ported test-first

`stream.go` was written before `stream_test.go`, which breaks the rule in
[`conventions/tdd.md`](conventions/tdd.md). The test was then ported from
`TestCOSStream` rather than written against the Go, so the assertions are still
Java-derived — but the ordering was wrong, and the point of the rule is that
the ordering is what protects against confirming a mistranslation.

This is the second such lapse, after `pdfio`. Both are recorded rather than
quietly fixed.

### Method note — `pdfio` was not ported test-first

The port now runs test-first ([`conventions/tdd.md`](conventions/tdd.md)).
`pdfio` predates that rule and did not follow it: the implementation was written
first and the Java tests were ported afterwards.

What that does and does not mean:

- The tests **are** faithful to the Java. Assertion values, the sample byte
  arrays, and the PDFBOX-numbered regression cases were copied from the Java
  test files, not recomputed from the Go. They are real evidence.
- But they did not **drive** the implementation, so they cannot rule out a
  mistranslation that the Java suite happens not to cover.

Everything from `slice/1` onward follows the rule. `pdfio` is the one package
where a later re-read against the Java is worth doing on its own — the chunk
arithmetic in `ReadBuffer` and the page-boundary handling in `BufferedFile` are
the parts where a silent mistranslation would be easiest to miss.

### Ported tests

| Java test | Go test | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RandomAccessReadBufferTest` | `readbuffer_test.go` | `testPDFBOX5111` not ported — it downloads a PDF over the network |
| `RandomAccessReadViewTest` | `readview_test.go` | complete |
| `RandomAccessReadWriteBufferTest` | `readwritebuffer_test.go` | complete |
| `SequenceRandomAccessReadTest` | `sequenceread_test.go` | complete |
| `RandomAccessReadBufferedFileTest` | `bufferedfile_test.go` | fixtures written to `t.TempDir()` instead of read from the source tree |
| `RandomAccessInputStreamTest` | `adapters_test.go` | complete |
| `ScratchFileBufferTest` | — | waiting on `ScratchFile` |
| `NonSeekableRandomAccessReadInputStreamTest` | — | waiting on that type |
| `RandomAccessReadMemoryMappedFileTest` | — | waiting on that type |
| `TestIOUtils` | — | mostly covers methods that map to the Go stdlib |

### Deviations from Java recorded so far

Each of these carries a comment at the point of difference in the Go source.

- `CreateView` hands every caller its own cursor instead of caching one clone
  per thread id. Go has no stable goroutine identity, and the result is safe for
  concurrent use where the Java version is not.
- `ReadBuffer.Read` stops when a chunk read returns nothing rather than adding
  `-1` to its running count, which the Java loop does.
- `BufferedFile` shares one mutex-guarded page cache across all cursors, where
  Java reopens the file per thread.
- The evicted page buffer is not reused for the next page read, so a cursor
  still holding an evicted page keeps reading valid bytes.
- `BufferedFile.IsEOF` compares offset against length instead of `peek() == -1`.
- End of input is `io.EOF` throughout, not a `-1` return.
